Hello, I'm Sarp. This is my blog where I plan to post about programming (linux, python, bash, R, etc.) and various other things. My primary goal for the blog is to organize my learning for myself, but the posts will hopefully prove useful to others as well.
They will range from in-depth explorations to documenting a single command option that I found useful. Also, here is my kitten Zeytin.
